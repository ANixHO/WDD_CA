            The RSPCA subscribes to the "Five Domains" model developed by Prof David Mellor and Dr Cam Reid in 1994,
            which outlined a way to identify and grade the severity of different welfare issues.
            By examining the physical and functional factors of nutrition, environment, health and behaviour and
            how they impact on an animal's mental state, the welfare status of an animal could be determined.
            This model was based on the Five Freedoms for animals.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Nutrition:
                Animals must have access to suitable quantities of a balanced diet of a
                variety of nutritious foods and water for optimal health.</li>
            <li>Environment:
                Animals must have safe, ample space with suitable temperature,
                air flow, light and protection from noise for optimal health.</li>
            <li>Health
                Animals must be treated for disease, injury or functional
                impairment to maintain an appropriate body condition and good fitness.</li>
            <li>Behaviour
                Animals must be provided with opportunities to engage in play,
                explore, move, bond and interact with others of their species,
                and have suitable space to retreat and sleep.</li>
            <li>Mental State
                An animal's overall welfare is directly affected by factors of nutrition,
                environment, health and behaviour, which all impact on the mental health
                of animals.</li>
